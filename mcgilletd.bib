	abstract = {To maximize specific ecosystem services ({ES}) such as food production, people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and {ES}. Communities need information about how land-use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and {ES}, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Montérégie Connection ({MC}) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Montérégien landscape just east of Montreal, Québec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences {ES} provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on {ES} provision, and show that {ES} provision can vary significantly even within single landuse types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of {ES} provision, as well as relationships among individual {ES}, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative {ES}-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on {ES} provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect {ES} provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the {MC} project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and {ES} provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and {ES}, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable socialecological system in the region.},

	abstract = {The set of models available to predict land use change in urban regions has become increasingly complex in recent years. Despite their complexity, the predictive power of these models remains relatively weak. This paper presents an example of an alternative modeling framework based on the concept of a Markov chain. The model assumes that land use at any given time, which is viewed as a discrete state, can be considered a function of only its previous state. The probability of transition between each pair of states is recorded as an element of a transition probability matrix. Assuming that this matrix is stationary over time, it can be used to predict future land use distributions from current data. To illustrate this process, a Markov chain model is estimated for the Minneapolis-St. Paul, {MN}, {USA} (Twin Cities) metropolitan region. Using a unique set of historical land use data covering several years between 1958 and 2005, the model is tested using historical data to predict recent conditions, and is then used to forecast the future distribution of land use decades into the future. We also use the cell-level data set to estimate the fraction of regional land use devoted to transportation facilities, including major highways, airports, and railways. The paper concludes with some comments on the strengths and weaknesses of Markov chains as a land use modeling framework, and suggests some possible extensions of the model.},

In this regard, a huge number of models have been developed to support future land-use planning and environmental impact assessments of land-use change activities. Within land-use change models, methodological integration is recognized as an essential feature for a complete model, which can help to combine the strength of single modelling methods/techniques without inherent weaknesses. Despite the potential and remarkable growth of methodological integration in land-use change models, limited attention has been paid to this aspect of integration. In response to this, the authors’ paper summarizes the current major land-use modelling methods/techniques, and explains the co-integration of these methods/techniques. In addition, they summarize the achievements, limitations and future trends in the use of the methodological integration approach in land-use change models.},

These decisions are made based on quantitatively measurable information like topography and on qualitative criteria such as personal preferences. Bayesian networks ({BN}) are able to integrate both quantitative and qualitative data and are thus suitable to approach such processes. We model land use decisions in a pre-Alpine area in Switzerland, integrating biophysical data and local actors’ knowledge into a spatially explicit {BN}. A structured experts’ process to elaborate three different {BN} including agriculture, forestry, and settlement provides the base for the modeling. A spatially explicit updating of the {BN} via questionnaires enables us to take local actors’ characteristics into account. Results show which drivers are most important for land use decision-making in our case study region, and how an alteration of these drivers could change future land use. Furthermore, focusing on the probability of occurrence of various land uses in a spatially explicit manner gives insights into path-dependency of land use change. This knowledge can serve as information for planners and policy makers to design more effective policy instruments.},

A hybrid model consisting of logistic regression model, Markov chain ({MC}), and cellular automata ({CA}) was designed to improve the performance of the standard logistic regression model. Environmental and socio-economic variables dealing with urban sprawl were operationalised to create a probability surface of spatiotemporal states of built-up land use for the years 2006, 2016, and 2026. For validation, the model was evaluated by means of relative operating characteristic values for different sets of variables. The approach was calibrated for 2006 by cross comparing of actual and simulated land use maps. The achieved outcomes represent a match of 89\% between simulated and actual maps of 2006, which was satisfactory to approve the calibration process. Thereafter, the calibrated hybrid approach was implemented for forthcoming years. Finally, future land use maps for 2016 and 2026 were predicted by means of this hybrid approach. The simulated maps illustrate a new wave of suburban development in the vicinity of Tehran at the western border of the metropolis during the next decades.},

This model was initially conceived for the simulation of Amazonian landscape dynamics, particularly the landscapes evolved in areas occupied by small farms. For testing its performance, the model was used to simulate spatial patterns of land-use and land-cover changes produced by the Amazonian colonists in clearing the forest, cultivating the land, and eventually abandoning it for vegetation succession. The study area is located in an Amazonian colonization frontier in the north of Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The model was run for two sub-areas of colonization projects, using an 8-year time span, from 1986 to 1994. The simulated maps were compared with land-use and land-cover maps, obtained from digital classification of remote sensing images, using the multiple resolution fitting procedure and a set of landscape structure measures, including fractal dimension, contagion index, and the number of patches for each type of land-use and land-cover class. The results from the validation methods for the two areas showed a good performance of the model, indicating that it can be used for replicating the spatial patterns created by landscape dynamics in Amazonian colonization regions occupied by small farms. Possible applications of dinamica include the evaluation of landscape fragmentation produced by different architectures of colonization projects and the prediction of a region's spatial pattern evolution according to various dynamic phases.},

Adequate production of locally produced services and services which are more accessible when produced locally is challenging in the context of dense urban development that is characteristic of {NYC}. Management approaches are needed to address scale mismatches in the production and consumption of ecosystem services.

This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity. The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area ({BMA}), 16\% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65\% of the {BMA} area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18\% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5\% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7\% of the {BMA} that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.},

	abstract = {Humans are producing complex and often undesirable social and ecological outcomes in many landscapes around the world. To sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services in fragmented landscapes conservation planning has turned to the identification and protection of large-scale spatial ecological networks ({SEN}). Now widely adopted, this approach typically focuses on static connectivity, and ignores the feedbacks between changes to the network's topology and the eco-evolutionary dynamics on the network. We review theory showing that diversity, stability, ecosystem functioning and evolutionary adaptation all vary nonlinearly with connectivity. Measuring and modelling an {SEN}'s long-term dynamics is immensely challenging but necessary if our goal is sustainability. We show an example where the robustness of an {SEN}'s ecological properties to node and link loss depends on the centrality of the nodes targeted. The design and protection of sustainable {SENs} requires scenarios of how landscape change affects network structure and the feedback this will have on dynamics. Once established, {SEN} must be monitored if their design is to be adapted to keep their dynamics within a safe and socially just operating space. When {SEN} are co-designed with a broad array of stakeholders and actors they can be a powerful means of creating a more positive relationship between people and nature.},

One prominent {SES} framework focusing on local resource use has been developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts, defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software engineering. We find that {SES} frameworks could include the following seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships, subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers, defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may also be beneficial for the development of other {SES} frameworks.},

The model is illustrated with an application for European land use. Interactions between changing demands for agricultural land and vegetation processes leading to the re-growth of (semi-) natural vegetation on abandoned farmland are explicitly addressed. Succession of natural vegetation is simulated based on the spatial variation in biophysical and management related conditions, while the dynamics of the agricultural area are determined by a global multi-sector model. The results allow an exploration of the future dynamics of European land use and landscapes. The model approach is similarly suitable for other regions and processes where large scale processes interact with local dynamics.},

The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species’ habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region’s connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.},

	abstract = {Land-use change can have local-to-global environment impacts such as loss of biodiversity and climate change as well as social-economic impacts such as social inequality. Models that are built to analyze land-use change can help us understand the causes and effects of change, which can provide support and evidence to land-use planning and land-use policies to eliminate or alleviate potential negative outcomes. A variety of modelling approaches have been developed and implemented to represent land-use change, in which statistical methods are often used in the classification of land use as well as to test hypotheses about the significance of potential drivers of land-use change. The utility of statistical models is found in the ease of their implementation and application as well as their ability to provide a general representation of land-use change given a limited amount of time, resources, and data. Despite the use of many different statistical methods for modelling land-use change, comparison among more than two statistical methods is rare and an evaluation of the performance of a combination of different statistical methods with the same dataset is lacking. The presented research fills this gap in land-use modelling literature using four statistical methods—Markov chain, logistic regression, generalized additive models and survival analysis—to quantify their ability to represent land-use change. The four methods were compared across three dimensions: accuracy (overall and by land-use type), sample size, and spatial independence via conventional and spatial cross-validation. Our results show that the generalized additive model outperformed the other three models in terms of overall accuracy and was the best for modelling most land-use changes with both conventional and spatial cross-validation regardless of sample size. Logistic regression and survival analysis were more accurate for specific land-use types, and Markov chain was able to represent those changes that could not be modeled by other approaches due to sample size restrictions. Spatial cross-validation accuracies were slightly lower than the conventional cross-validation accuracies. Our results demonstrate that not only is the choice of model by land-use type more important than sample size, but also that a hybrid land-use model comprising the best statistical modelling approaches for each land-use change can outperform individual statistical approaches. While Markov chain was not competitive, it was useful in providing representation using other methods or in other cases where there is no predictor data.},

The objective of this study was to test a random forest-cellular automata ({RF}-{CA}) model, which combines random forest ({RF}) and cellular automata ({CA}) models. The Kappa simulation ({KSimulation}), figure of merit, and components of agreement and disagreement statistics were used to validate the {RF}-{CA} model. Furthermore, the {RF}-{CA} model was compared with support vector machine cellular automata ({SVM}-{CA}) and logistic regression cellular automata ({LR}-{CA}) models. Results show that the {RF}-{CA} model outperformed the {SVM}-{CA} and {LR}-{CA} models. The {RF}-{CA} model had a Kappa simulation ({KSimulation}) accuracy of 0.51 (with a figure of merit statistic of 47\%), while {SVM}-{CA} and {LR}-{CA} models had a {KSimulation} accuracy of 0.39 and −0.22 (with figure of merit statistics of 39\% and 6\%), respectively. Generally, the  {RF}-{CA} model was relatively accurate at allocating “non-built-up to built-up” changes as reflected by the correct “non-built-up to built-up” components of agreement of 15\%. The performance of the {RF}-{CA} model was attributed to the relatively accurate {RF} transition potential maps. Therefore, this study highlights the potential of the {RF}-{CA} model for simulating urban growth.},

	abstract = {This paper explores potential future land use/cover ({LUC}) dynamics in the Attica region, Greece, under three distinct economic performance scenarios. During the last decades, Attica underwent a significant and predominantly unregulated process of urban growth, due to a substantial increase in housing demand coupled with limited land use planning controls. However, the recent financial crisis affected urban growth trends considerably. This paper uses the observed {LUC} trends between 1991 and 2016 to sketch three divergent future scenarios of economic development. The observed {LUC} trends are then analysed using 27 dynamic, biophysical, socio-economic, terrain and proximity-based factors, to generate transition potential maps, implementing a Random Forests ({RF}) regression modelling approach. Scenarios are projected to 2040 by implementing a spatially explicit Cellular Automata ({CA}) model. The resulting maps are subjected to a multiple resolution sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of spatial resolution of the input data to the model outputs. Findings show that, under the current setting of an underdeveloped land use planning apparatus, a long-term scenario of high economic growth will increase built-up surfaces in the region by almost 24\%, accompanied by a notable decrease in natural areas and cropland. Interestingly, in the case that the currently negative economic growth rates persist, artificial surfaces in the region are still expected to increase by approximately 7.5\% by 2040.},

	abstract = {This paper compares two land change models in terms of appropriateness for various applications and predictive power. Cellular Automata Markov ({CA}\_Markov) and Geomod are the two models, which have similar options to allow for specification of the predicted quantity and location of land categories. The most important structural difference is that {CA}\_Markov has the ability to predict any transition among any number of categories, while Geomod predicts only a one‐way transition from one category to one alternative category. To assess the predictive power, each model is run several times to predict land change in central Massachusetts, {USA}. The models are calibrated with information from 1971 to 1985, and then the models predict the change from 1985 to 1999. The method to measure the predictive power: 1) separates the calibration process from the validation process, 2) assesses the accuracy at multiple resolutions, and 3) compares the predictive model vis‐à‐vis a null model that predicts pure persistence. Among 24 model runs, the predictive models are more accurate than the null model at resolutions coarser than two kilometres, but not at resolutions finer than one kilometre. The choice of the options account for more variation in accuracy of runs than the choice of the model per se. The most accurate model runs are those that did not use spatial contiguity explicitly. For this particular study area, the added complexity of {CA}\_Markov is of no benefit.},
