abstract = {Savanna water management is predicated on the hypothesis that surface water availability can be manipulated at scales that influence herbivore distributions. Using a case study in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, we assess the contribution of perennial and ephemeral water sources to surface water availability in the dry season. We posit that surface water availability in savanna ecosystems exists along a continuum of being determined primarily by perennial or ephemeral water sources and propose that locating an ecosystem along this continuum provides a means to evaluate the utility of water management. We also develop general hypotheses about the relative response of herbivore species to ephemeral water sources. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Augmenting natural water supplies by providing artificial waterpoints is an intervention commonly adopted by managers of national parks and other large protected areas. Contrasting policies are currently being followed in three of the premier national parks in southern Africa. Some empirical guidelines for waterpoint provision are suggested by case histories of these and other wildlife reserves. A geometric model, based on the rotation of water-dependent herbivores between wet season and dry season ranges, is outlined to indicate the appropriate spacing between perennial waterpoints. The aim is to apportion vegetation impacts evenly between these ranges, and allow plants a period of recovery from severe grazing pressure. The model suggests that a much wider spacing between perennial water sources is advisable than is currently operative in most conservation areas. Seasonal waterpoints reduce the period of concentration near perennial water, but prolong use of vegetaion in the wet season range. Excessive waterpoints (1) favour water-dependent ungulates and elephants at the expense of rarer ungulates, (2) increase predator impacts on prey populations, (3) wided vegetation degredation, (4) worsen animal mortality during droughts, (5) decrease ecosystem stability, and (6) lead to a loss of biodiversity},

abstract = {Wildlife diseases in South Africa, can be divided into two categories: endemic diseases which evolved with and cycle in the various indigenous wildlife populations; and, exotic diseases suspected of having been introduced onto the African continent (by domestic stock) and considered capable of infecting and killing indigenous wildlife. This paper tends to review the latter. Foot and mouth disease caused by SAT virus is the most economically important viral disease in South Africa. Elephant appear to be insusceptible to natural challenge of SAT and although elephant have been experimentally infected by large scale injections cattle and other elephants placed in close contact with these infected animals failed to become infected. Positive serological titres for Rift Valley Fever have been found in Kruger NP elephants. The history of bluetongue in Africa suggests is was a viral disease of wildlife and antibodies have been found in elephant. Elephant are susceptible to both human and domestic strains of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium spp. Southern African elephant have been infected and died from anthrax.},

abstract = {Non-communicable diseases dominate the public health arena in China, yet neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are still widespread and create a substantial burden. We review the geographical distribution, prevalence, and epidemic characteristics of NTDs identified in China caused by helminths, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. Lymphatic filariasis was eliminated in 2007, but schistosomiasis still affects up to 5{\%} of local village residents in some endemic counties with around 300 000 people infected. China harbours more than 90{\%} of the world's burden of alveolar echinococcosis and food-borne zoonoses are emerging. In 2010, the overall prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm was 11·4{\%}, with 6·8{\%} of these infections caused by A lumbricoides. Corresponding figures for food-borne trematodiasis, echinococcosis, and cysticercosis are more than 5{\%}. Dengue, leishmaniasis, leprosy, rabies, and trachoma exist in many areas and should not be overlooked. Transmission of vector-borne diseases can be interrupted; nevertheless, epidemics occur in remote areas, creating a challenge for surveillance and control. Rigorous surveillance, followed by immediate and integrated response packages tailored to specific social and ecological systems, is essential for progress towards the elimination of NTDs in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
